Repository Description: Amazon Clone - HTML &amp; CSS Frontend 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Amazon Clone project, a frontend web development endeavor that faithfully recreates the user interface of the Amazon e-commerce platform using only HTML and CSS.

Project Overview:
-----------------
This repository houses the source code for the frontend design of our Amazon Clone project. While it's important to note that this is a frontend-only implementation, it showcases the power of HTML and CSS in replicating the look and feel of one of the world's largest online retailers.

Features:
---------
- **Responsive Design:** Our Amazon Clone is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across various devices, from desktop to mobile.

- **HTML Structure:** The project's HTML structure is carefully organized to mimic the layout and hierarchy of the original Amazon website.

- **CSS Styling:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) have been used extensively to style each element, achieving the same visual aesthetics as Amazon.

- **Product Listings:** Explore how we've crafted product listing pages, complete with product cards, images, and pricing.

- **Navigation:** Experience the navigation menu and search bar, designed to mirror Amazon's intuitive navigation system.

- **Checkout Flow:** Although this is a frontend-only project, you can get a glimpse of how an Amazon-style checkout flow might look and feel.
